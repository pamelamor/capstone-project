# What is Studybit?
- Studybit is a flashcard app that aims to provide users with a free and intuitive way to create foreign study language materials! The web-app allows users to create an account that require a phone number at registration. With this information Studybit is able to send daily study reminders by utilizing the Twilio API and a crontab script that runs in the background. This app also gives users the power to personalize their materials in hopes of making learning more fun and flexible. Users can create, delete, modify and customize flashcards and decks in Design Space/ Workspace, and are able to see their styling come to life in study sessions where they can practice their languages.
